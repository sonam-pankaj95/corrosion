estimating corrosion using image processing and SVM or n-layered NN


Basically, I am using the property of Entropy variation with contrast to find a corroded area or patch on a metal surface because CNN is not good enough for classification of corrosion. We though of using the property of Natural vs Artificial texture and pass it through a svm or any n-layered neural network. 

the file linked to it was performed only on one image but it gave tangible results so further work includes to perform it on thousands of image and see the results.
