# corrosion
estimating corrosion using image processing and SVM or n-layered NN


Basically, I am using the property of Entropy variation with contrast to find a corroded area or patch on a metal surface because CNN is not good enough for classification of corrosion. We though of using the property of Natural vs Artificial texture and pass it through a svm or any n-layered neural network. 

The First Image is corroded and is imported as image1
